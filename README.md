# PyJack
This is a working game of blackjack that runs on Python's "turtle" graphics engine. If you know how to play blackjack, than this should be simple. If you don't know how to play, than just read this: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/

I hope you enjoy playing with this, me and my friend Eric worked very hard to make this, and if you have any feature requests or optimization suggestions, please feel free to make an issue.

You can edit the colors and designs of the cards and everything else, just DO NOT mess with the "blackjack.py" file. it runs the entire thing and changing it could break the entire program.

To play with this, simply clone this repo and click on "blackjack.py". (A Python backend is required.)
